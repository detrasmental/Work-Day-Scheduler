# **Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler**

## My Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Acceptance Criteria

**GIVEN** I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

**WHEN** I open the planner

**THEN** the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

**WHEN** I scroll down

**THEN** I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

**WHEN** I view the time blocks for that day

**THEN** each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

**WHEN** I click into a time block

**THEN** I can enter an event

**WHEN** I click the save button for that time block

**THEN** the text for that event is saved in local storage

**WHEN** I refresh the page

**THEN** the saved events persist
